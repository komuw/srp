# Secure Remote Password

Package srp is a Go implementation of
[Secure Remote Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol)
protocol as defined by [RFC 2945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2945) and
[RFC 5054](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054).

> SRP is an authentication method that allows the use
> of user names and passwords over unencrypted channels without
> revealing the password to an eavesdropper. SRP also supplies a
> shared secret at the end of the authentication sequence that can be
> used to generate encryption keys.

It's based on the work of [1Password](https://github.com/1Password/srp),
with a key changes to restore compatibility with the RFC, and to make
the codebase more idiomatic.

SRP is used by leading privacy-conscious companies such as
[Apple](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/escrow-security-for-icloud-keychain-sec3e341e75d/web), [1Password](https://blog.1password.com/developers-how-we-use-srp-and-you-can-too/),
[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/blog/cryptographic-architecture-response/),
and yours truly.

## Protocol

Conceptually, SRP is not different from how most of us think about
authentication; the client signs up by storing a secret on the server, and to
login, it must prove to the server that it knows it.

With SRP, the client signs up by storing a cryptographic value (`verifier`)
derived from its password on the server. To login, they both exchange a
series of values they compute they both share but never exchange to prove to
each other who they are.

Trust can be established at the end of the process because for the
server, only the client who knows the `verifier` could have sent those values,
and for the client, and vice versa.

SRP comes with four major benefits:

1. The familiar user-experience of using a username and a password remains
   fundamentally the same;
1. Server cannot leak a password it never saw;
1. Both client and server can formally verify each other's identities without
   needing a third-party (e.g CA);
1. Sessions can be secured with an extra layer of encryption on top of TLS.

### Registration

During registration, the client must send the server a `verifier`, a
cryptographic value derived from the user's password, and a unique random salt
associated with her.

```go
var (
  group = srp.RFC5054Group2048
  username = "alice@example.com"
  password = "p@$$w0rd"
)
tp, err := srp.ComputeVerifier(group, username, password, srp.NewRandomSalt())
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("error computing verifier: %v", err)
}

// The verifier can be accessed via the returned triplet tp
// as tp.Verifier().

// On the server, it's recommended to store the verifier along with
// the username and the salt used to compute it, so sending the whole
// triplet tp ([]byte) is more appropriate.
Send(tp)
```

The `group` parameter refers to a set of values known to both the client and
the server, and which will be used in all cryptographic computations.
[RFC 5054](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054) defines a number of them.

The `Triplet` returned by this function encapsulates three variables into a
single byte array that the server can store in a database:

- Username
- Verifier
- Salt

It's important for the server to treat the triplet with care, as it contains
a secret value (`verifier`) which should never be shared with anyone.

The `salt` value it contains however should be made available publicly to
_anyone who asks_ via a public URL.

### Login

When it's time to authenticate a user, client and server follow a three-step
process:

1. `client` and `server` exchange ephemeral public keys `A` and `B`,
   respectively;
2. `client` computes a proof and sends it to the server;
3. `server` checks the client's proof and sends the client a proof of their own.

#### Client-side

On the client side, the first step is to initialize a `Client`.

```go
var (
  group = srp.RFC5054Group2048
  username = "alice@example.com"
  password = "p@$$w0rd"
  salt []byte                     // Retrieved from the server
)
client, err := srp.NewClient(group, username, password, salt)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```

All the values must match those used to create the verifier that was stored
on the server. The `salt` should be retrievable from the server without
requiring prior authentication.

The next step is to send the ephemeral public key `A` to the server:

```go
A := client.A()

// Send A to the server
```

The server will do the same, sending their ephemeral public key `B` instead.
Configure it on the client as following:

```go
var B []byte // Received from the server

client.SetB(B)
```

Next, compute the client proof and send it to the server.

```go
M1, err := client.ComputeM1()
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("error computing proof: %v", err)
}

// send M1 to the server
```

If the server accepts the client's proof, they will send their own server proof.

```go
var M2 []byte // Received from the server

ok, err :=client.CheckM2(M2)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("error checking M2: %v", err)
}
if !ok {
  log.Fatalf("server is not authentic")
}
```

At this stage, the client and the server can trust each other, and can
(optionally) use a shared encryption key to secure their session from this
point on.

```go
sharedKey, err := client.SessionKey()
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("error computing key: %v", err)
}

// sharedKey is a 256 bit key which was computed
// locally.
```

#### Server-side

The process on the server-side is very similar to the above, with one key
difference: the server must first receive and verify a proof the client (`M1`)
before it computes and sends its own (`M2`).

```go
var (
  group = srp.RFC5054Group2048  // Same as the one used on the client
  triplet srp.Triplet           // Retrieved from the server
)
server, err := srp.NewServer(group, username, password, salt)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```

The next step is to wait for the user to send their ephemeral public key `A`
to configure it on the server.

```go
var A []byte // received from the client

if err := server.setA(A); err != nil {
  log.Fatal("error configuring A: %v", err)
}
```

If no error is caught, the next step is to send to server's ephemeral public
key `B` to the client.

```go
B := server.B()

// send B to the client
```

Now the server must wait for the client to submit their proof `M1`.

```go
var M1 []byte   // Received from the client

ok, err := server.CheckM1(M1)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("error verifying M1: %v", err)
}

if !ok {
  log.Fatalf("client is not authentic")
}
```

If this verification fails, the process must stop at this point, and no further
information should be shared with the client over this session. A new `Server`
instance will need to be created and the negotiation restarted.

If successful, the server can consider the client as _authentic_, but it
still needs to send its own proof `M2`.

```go
M2, err := server.ComputeM2()
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("error computing M2: %v", err)
}

// send M2 to the client
```

If the client accepts the proof, they can both consider each other as
_authentic_ and compute their shared session key to encrypt their exchanges
and protect themselves from eavesdropping.

```go
sharedKey, err := server.SessionKey()
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("error computing key: %v", err)
}

// sharedKey is a 256 bit key which was computed
// locally.
```

## Implementation

SRP is protocol-agnostic and can be implemented on top of any existing
client/server architecture.

At Posterity, we use a custom websocket protocol, but a simple HTTP API would
be equally suitable. In any case, the process can usually be completed in
two round-trips, excluding the request needed to retrieve the `salt` value
of the user:

```plain
(Client) üëßüèº  ---------‚Üí A
                        B   ‚Üê--------- üë®üèΩ (Server)

(Client) üëßüèº  ---------‚Üí M1
                        M2  ‚Üê--------- üë®üèΩ (Server)

```

If you're using a stateless architecture (e.g. REST), `Server` can be
encoded/decoded to/from JSON or Go's own [gob](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/gob),
allowing you to save and restore its internal state as needed. Bear in
mind that a `Server`'s internal state contains the user's `verifier`, and
should therefore be handled appropriately.

A secure connection between the client and the server is a necessity,
especially when the client first needs to send their `verifier` to the server.

## Session Encryption

SRP defines a way for the client and the server to independently compute a
strong but ephemeral encryption key which they can use to secure their
communications during a session.

At Posterity, we use
[Encrypted-Content-Encoding for HTTP](https://github.com/posterity/ece) to set
that in motion.
